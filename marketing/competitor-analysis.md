## Our Positioning: GetAutoReply

### Price Advantage
| Plan | GetAutoReply | Interakt | Wati | AiSensy |
|------|-------------|----------|------|---------|
| Entry | ₹299/mo | ₹919/mo | ₹2,499/mo | ₹999/mo |
| Mid | ₹499/mo | ₹2,299/mo | ₹5,999/mo | ₹2,399/mo |

**We're 3-8x cheaper than competitors!**

### Target Difference
- **Competitors:** D2C, e-commerce, tech-savvy businesses
- **Us:** Kirana, doctors, tutors, salons - the 60M+ Indian SMBs who use WhatsApp but aren't tech-savvy

### Messaging
> "Vyapar for WhatsApp" - Simple, affordable, Hindi-first

### Key Differentiators
1. **Price:** ₹299 vs ₹999+ competition
2. **Simplicity:** 5 auto-replies, not 50 features
3. **Language:** Hindi-first templates
4. **Target:** Bharat SMBs, not metro startups

## Competitor Weaknesses to Exploit

1. **Too expensive** - ₹2,499/month is a full day's earnings for a kirana owner
2. **Too complex** - Dashboards designed for marketers, not shopkeepers
3. **English-only** - Limited Hindi support
4. **Overkill features** - Chatbots, flows, integrations nobody asked for

## Our Pitch
*"Wati costs ₹2,499/month. That's 8x what we charge. And you probably only need 5 auto-replies anyway."*
