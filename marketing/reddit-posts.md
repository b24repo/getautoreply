**Title:** Built a WhatsApp auto-reply bot for small Indian businesses - looking for feedback

```
Hey r/india!

I've been working on a side project and finally launched it today.

**The Problem:**
Small business owners (kirana stores, doctors, tutors, salons) get 50+ WhatsApp messages daily with the same questions:
- "Price kya hai?"
- "Timing?"
- "Open hai?"

They can't reply when busy serving customers. Late night messages? Forget it.

**The Solution:**
GetAutoReply - a simple WhatsApp auto-reply bot.
- Set up auto-replies once
- Bot handles messages 24/7
- You focus on your business

**Pricing:** Starting at ₹299/month (much cheaper than Wati/Interakt at ₹2,500+)

Currently collecting early signups: https://getautoreply.in

Would love feedback from this community. What features would you want?

## r/Entrepreneur or r/startups

**Title:** Launched my first SaaS today - WhatsApp auto-reply for Indian SMBs

```
Hey everyone!

After 2 weeks of building, I launched GetAutoReply today.

**What it does:** Auto-replies to WhatsApp messages for small businesses

**Target market:** India's 60M+ small businesses using WhatsApp as primary customer channel

**Why I built it:** 
Existing solutions (Wati, Interakt) cost ₹2,500+/month. Too expensive for kirana stores, tutors, small clinics. I'm offering the same at ₹299/month.

**Current stage:** Landing page + waitlist. Building MVP.

**Traction so far:** [X] waitlist signups on day 1

Looking for:
1. Feedback on the landing page
2. Anyone in Indian SMB space to chat with
3. Early users willing to test

Happy to answer questions about the Indian market!
