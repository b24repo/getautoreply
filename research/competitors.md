## Competitive Responses

### If asked "Why not Wati?"
> "Wati is great for big brands. But if you're a kirana store or tutor, you don't need CRM, broadcast, or team inbox. You just need auto-reply. Why pay ₹2,500 for features you won't use? GetAutoReply does one thing well at ₹299."

### If asked "What's different?"
> "We're built specifically for small Indian businesses. Simple setup, affordable price, Hindi support. No complicated features - just auto-reply that works."
